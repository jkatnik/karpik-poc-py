00:00:00,729  -->  00:00:06,690
In this part, I will share some tips to help you learn, and get the maximum value from this course.

2
00:00:10,780  -->  00:00:14,100
The first tip, make yourself comfortable.

3
00:00:14,460  -->  00:00:18,960
Grab a hot drink, some cake, and a warm blanket if you have to.

5
00:00:19,260  -->  00:00:23,500
Enjoy learning new things, and keep your spirit high.

6
00:00:23,940  -->  00:00:26,240
Thank you for purchasing this course.

7
00:00:30,180  -->  00:00:37,020
Some students that learning online, what they
do is watching the video, and type along to the code or instructions.

9
00:00:39,700  -->  00:00:47,460
This means, when the lesson type a line, the
student also type a line, or pausing the video so often.

11
00:00:49,040  -->  00:00:52,820
So basically, the student type along with the instructor.

12
00:00:54,560  -->  00:01:02,020
My recommendation, is you watch the lecture
for about five to ten minutes, without typing
or if the lecture is quite long like 20 minutes
or more, pause the video for about every ten minutes.

15
00:01:11,960  -->  00:01:19,620
Within that ten minutes period, try to understand:
what are the code or instructions, what are the purpose behind them.

17
00:01:22,080  -->  00:01:27,120
Then you try to replicate them at your environment.

18
00:01:27,520  -->  00:01:34,400
So, instead of just copying the code or instruction,
you get understanding of what is going on and absorb that knowledge.

20
00:01:41,440  -->  00:01:44,540
The next tip is actually about me.

21
00:01:44,820  -->  00:01:53,340
I’m not a native english speaker, so for
some of you, my accent might unusual or even weird.

22
00:01:56,540  -->  00:02:02,160
In such case, I provide the english subtitle
for most of my lectures.

23
00:02:02,480  -->  00:02:08,840
The english subtitle is not an auto generated
one, but I type it manually, so it will be almost 100% accurate.

25
00:02:11,000  -->  00:02:13,860
You can turn on the subtitle from here.

26
00:02:21,100  -->  00:02:25,780
Or maybe I’m speaking too slow, or too fast.

27
00:02:26,020  -->  00:02:30,500
In that case, you can change the playback
speed using this button.

28
00:02:43,620  -->  00:02:51,340
The curriculum is designed to increase step-by-step,
so we start slow at the beginning, but then we run faster.

30
00:02:53,120  -->  00:02:56,800
I recommend that you are not skip any of the
lectures.

31
00:02:57,520  -->  00:03:02,800
If you skip one or more lecture, you might
get lost in later lecture.

32
00:03:03,400  -->  00:03:09,800
However, if there is any optional lecture,
or something that basically a tip, I will make a note on such lecture, so you can skip it without much missing knowledge.

34
00:03:19,540  -->  00:03:25,240
At some point, you might get stuck on a lecture,
and it’s OK.

35
00:03:25,240  -->  00:03:28,380
It’s the joy of learning new things.

36
00:03:28,380  -->  00:03:34,760
We get stuck, we try to find out the solution,
and when we find the solution, we can feel such happy feeling when we overcome challenge.

38
00:03:38,320  -->  00:03:43,300
But, not all of us has enough time to find the solution.

39
00:03:43,620  -->  00:03:47,040
In such case, I recommend few tips:

40
00:03:49,360  -->  00:03:56,340
1st, if it’s about the course content, find
out the Q and A section on the course.

41
00:03:59,740  -->  00:04:04,620
You can find similar issue there, or ask the
question to instructor.

42
00:04:07,360  -->  00:04:10,780
2nd, go to stack overflow.

43
00:04:11,140  -->  00:04:16,780
You know, stack overflow is like a global
knowledge for programming questions.

44
00:04:17,500  -->  00:04:21,040
Or you can always google.

45
00:04:24,760  -->  00:04:29,680
At some time during the course, udemy might
ask you to rate the course.

46
00:04:29,680  -->  00:04:36,910
Please give a rate and review, so I can keep
improve the course, and some other people can also understand the course strength and
weakness before they purchase it.

48
00:04:44,340  -->  00:04:49,980
If software to be installed is newer than
that being used in this course, it should be OK as long as the major version has not
change.

50
00:04:54,860  -->  00:05:00,380
For example, in some of my java courses, I
use Spring boot 2.

51
00:05:01,480  -->  00:05:06,980
When recording the video, I might use spring boot version 2.2 but then spring boot updated to version 2.4
Since the major version still version 2, the course should still relevant.

54
00:05:19,320  -->  00:05:26,840
If you use spring boot 1 or spring boot 3,
the course might still be usable, but need adjustment.

55
00:05:26,840  -->  00:05:31,200
Or its not usable at all, depends on the product.

56
00:05:32,000  -->  00:05:37,700
In some technical course, it is normal if
you find minor difference between source code
or screen design in video, and the resource
provided on lecture.

58
00:05:40,280  -->  00:05:45,880
It might happen because I update the lecture.

59
00:05:46,920  -->  00:05:54,640
In case newer version available which needs
major change, I will do my best to update the course.
