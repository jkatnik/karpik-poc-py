Hi guys, in this lesson we will talk about Shovel plugin of RabbitMQ. We can migrate messages

00:13.530 --> 00:17.670
from one queue to another queue with Shovel plugin.

00:17.970 --> 00:21.060
It works for queues on the same virtual host.

00:21.510 --> 00:24.870
We can find it in the queue details page.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.810
It is under the move section in the detail.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.720
Shovel is a plugin.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.440
By default we couldn't find it on RabbitMQ Management Console.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.080
So first of all we should install it.

00:37.350 --> 00:39.390
We can install it with a command.

00:39.630 --> 00:48.330
Actually when we check the move section in the queue details. We can find the install command. We can easily install it with this command.

00:49.410 --> 00:58.110
We will install the shovel and shovel management console. To use the shovel plugin.

00:58.830 --> 01:03.060
First of all, we should enable it from the RabbitMQ console.

01:06.620 --> 01:11.440
After we enabled it, we should log out and log in again.

01:19.130 --> 01:25.050
Now we can migrate our messages from one queue to another queue.

01:25.160 --> 01:30.210
To test it we will pick a queue, then we will go into the details of the source queue.

01:30.470 --> 01:33.560
Then from the move section, we will handle it.

01:33.890 --> 01:40.610
For example, we can move the message from the topic queue three to the topic queue two.

01:42.020 --> 01:50.210
But first of all, we will need the destination queue because the shovel moves messages from source queue to destination queue.

01:51.560 --> 01:55.720
By the way, we cannot move messages partially with the shovel.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.510
We can only move all queues at a time.

02:01.250 --> 02:06.200
After we move messages, we can see messages in the destination queue.

02:13.820 --> 02:14.570
That's all.

02:14.840 --> 02:15.350
Thank you.
