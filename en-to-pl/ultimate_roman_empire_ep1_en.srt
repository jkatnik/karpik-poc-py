mhm.

1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,360
The story of the Roman Empire

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,980
opens with a fairy tale.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,630
Once upon a time,

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,160
not far from here,

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,240
a princess gave birth to twin sons.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,670
King,

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,010
wicked uncle,

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,050
fearing that the boys would one day become his rivals

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,960
ordered his faithful servants to throw them into the river.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,110
But as it was in flood,

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,150
they just left them

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,840
in a basket at the water's edge, from where they floated downstream,

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,250
rescued on the bank by a mother wolf who suckled them.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,360
They were later found by a local shepherd who reared them as his own.

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,300
Their names were Romulus

16
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,430
and Remus.

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,150
They went on

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,220
to found

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,350
Rome.

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,640
Yeah.
